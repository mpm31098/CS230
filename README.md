1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
-The client was The Gaming Room and wanted a web-based game that served multiple platforms based on their current game which is an application on only on OS. 
  They needed help with the environment plan and developing recommendations and this software had to be able to implement basic design patterns, in addition to 
  having the players join different teams, and connect cross-platform.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  -I think I relayed information back to the client with plenty of information regarding the options they had. Along with laying the ground for what should be
  expected based off of certain things they picked. Such as the type of OS for example, they were notified of all 3 options and they were given the pros and
  cons of each of them to be able to help them make the decision that best suited their needs. Along with the recommendations on different types of storage
  and memory usage that would benefit them and the users.
  
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  -Working through the document made me more aware of what they wanted and gave me a chance to make sure I was including everything needed in it. 
  It made me pay more attention to details regarding what they wanted and what they already had. 
  
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  -The one thing I would revise would be the design constraints. I didn't add much information in there other than it was already an Android app but I would
  add in there the storage and memory issues that need to be accounted for with it going from an Android app to a cross-platform web-based game. I would also
  add the fact that with it being cross-platform it needs to meet the standards of all OS.
  
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  -You have to consider the user's needs while designing because the program has to be user-friendly for people to use it. If it is too hard or too complex
  it will drive users away which is the opposite of what needs to happen when trying to make the program available to more people. 
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
